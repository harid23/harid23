I’m a highly motivated and passionate final-year IT student with a strong foundation in Core Java and .NET Development. I love building applications from scratch, and I specialize in API development, backend logic, and full-stack solutions.

Currently, I am exploring React Native for mobile development while continuously improving my backend skills. My goal is to leverage my expertise to create seamless, user-friendly solutions across platforms.
